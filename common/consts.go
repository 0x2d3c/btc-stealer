// Purpose is a constant set to 44' (or 0x8000002C) following the BIP43 recommendation.
// It indicates that the subtree of this node is used according to this specification.
//
// What does 44' mean in BIP44?
// https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/74368/what-does-44-mean-in-bip44
//
// 44' means that hardened keys should be used. The distinguisher for whether
// a key a given index is hardened is that the index is greater than 2^31,
// which is 2147483648. In hex, that is 0x80000000. That is what the apostrophe (') means.
// The 44 comes from adding it to 2^31 to get the final hardened key index.
// In hex, 44 is 2C, so 0x80000000 + 0x2C = 0x8000002C.
